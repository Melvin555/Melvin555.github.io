### Projects and Thesis

[Natural Language Processing](/NLP)
<p align="justify">
    The project revolves around data collection using a webcrawler package in python programming language. The data is a collection of sport new information from http://bbc.com. A corpus is built from the 10,000 sentences collected automatically by using the webcrawler related to sport news. Then, an English stemmer based on Porterâ€™s algorithm is implemented. After that, the constructed corpus is processed by using stemmer in which a dictionary is built. Lastly, a bigram model is built by selecting 10% of the total data as test data. 90% accuracy of classification is obtained.

[Brain Computer Interface-Imagination Recognition](/BCI-Imagination)
<p align="justify">
    The main project covers data collection from 15 different subjects from various country to imagine both 0 and 1. Subjects are given a sample image of 0 and 1 before being asked to recall the image by closing their eyes without looking at the image anymore. In the data processing and classification, the data is taken from the 10 seconds middle span out of 30 seconds per recording. Then, the data processing is divided into two parts: machine learning, and deep learning. For machine learning classification, after being band pass filtered within 10-13 Hz, pass through ICA and CSP preprocessing, the classification is done using LDA, logistic regression, SVM, and MLP (best result: MLP 60% classification rate). On the other hand, for the deep learning classification, after band pass filtered within 8-30 Hz,the topo-map images are produced and fed to the network. (99.68% classification rate)

[BCI-Robot Control](/BCI-RobotControl)
<p align="justify">
    Technology is very essential in assisting human to live these days. One of such technologies is biomedical engineering technology, with specific area focusing on Electroencephalogram (EEG). The use of EEG is not only limited for detecting neurons activity inside human brain, but it can also be used for control purpose. The use of EEG in control system is called Brain Computer Interface (BCI). The ultimate goal of BCI in general is to assist people with disabilities to have activities as those of normal people do. In this project, the purpose of the resulted prototype is to help people with disabilities to transport light items by means of attention level and eye blinking level. Both are utilized to
    control the movement of a land mobile robot.
