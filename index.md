    The project revolves around data collection using a webcrawler package in python programming language. The data is a collection of sport new information from http://bbc.com. A corpus is built from the 10,000 sentences collected automatically by using the webcrawler related to sport news. Then, an English stemmer based on Porterâ€™s algorithm is implemented. After that, the constructed corpus is processed by using stemmer in which a dictionary is built. Lastly, a bigram model is built by selecting 10% of the total data as test data. 90% accuracy of classification is obtained.
